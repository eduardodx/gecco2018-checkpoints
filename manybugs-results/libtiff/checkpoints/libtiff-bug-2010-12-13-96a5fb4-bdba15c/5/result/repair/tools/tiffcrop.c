/*!XXH_FORCE_MEMORY_ACCESS :
 * By default, access to unaligned memory is controlled by `memcpy()`, which is safe and portable.
 * Unfortunately, on some target/compiler combinations, the generated assembly is sub-optimal.
 * The below switch allow to select different access method for improved performance.
 * Method 0 (default) : use `memcpy()`. Safe and portable.
 * Method 1 : `__packed` statement. It depends on compiler extension (ie, not portable).
 *            This method is safe if your compiler supports it, and *generally* as fast or faster than `memcpy`.
 * Method 2 : direct access. This method doesn't depend on compiler but violate C standard.
 *            It can generate buggy code on targets which do not support unaligned memory accesses.
 *            But in some circumstances, it's the only known way to get the most performance (ie GCC + ARMv6)
 * See http://stackoverflow.com/a/32095106/646947 for details.
 * Prefer these methods in priority order (0 > 1 > 2)

Q.Score is a measure of quality of the hash function.
It depends on successfully passing SMHasher test set.
10 is a perfect score.

It offers much better speed, but for 64-bits applications only.

These functions generate the xxHash of an input provided in multiple segments.

For small input, prefer `XXH32()` and `XXH64()` .
XXH state must first be allocated, using XXH*_createState() .
Start a new hash by initializing state with a seed, using XXH*_reset().
Then, feed the hash state by calling XXH*_update() as many times as necessary.
Obviously, input must be allocated and read accessible.
The function returns an error code, with 0 meaning OK, and any other value meaning there is an error.
Finally, a hash value can be produced anytime, by using XXH*_digest().
This function returns the nn-bits hash as an int or long long.
It's still possible to continue inserting input into the hash state after a digest,
and generate some new hashes later on, by calling again XXH*_digest().
When done, free XXH state space if it was allocated dynamically.
